# We are the champions
## What is it? 
It's a website that lets you endorse someone with a positive comment! You have 3 inputs: the comment, from whom, and to whom. You can also see the comments uploaded by other people.
The website uses the Firebase database to store and retrieve the comments. This website is also the eighth project, and fifth SOLO project, part of the Scrimba Course, that I've uploaded to Github. This project is part of module 3, where they teach you how to use Javascript.
## What did I use?
I used HTML, CSS, Javascript, Firebase and one image. 
## Concepts learned from this project
- You can push objects to the Firebase database, without changing its format.
