# Shopping List Mobile App
## What is it? 
It's a website that lets you add shopping products to a list, that is connected to a Firebase database. This website also uses app manifest to look like an app on phones. 
It's also the seventh project, part of the Scrimba Course, that I've uploaded to Github. This project is part of module 3, where they teach you how to use Javascript.
## What did I use?
I used HTML, CSS, Javascript, Firebase, manifest.json, and multiple types of images.
## Concepts learned for this project and practiced during it
- **import** statement, to import function into your code.
  - ```Javascript
      import { functionName } from "route"
    ```
- **__FireBase__**: A service provided by Google to create and manage databases in a more friendly way.
  - **initializeApp()** to get started with FireBase. Connect with a URL passed as an argument.
    - ```Javascript
        initializeApp( { databaseURL: "databaseURL" } )
      ```
  - **getDatabase()** to connect with the database. You have to pass the variable where you stored the initializeApp() result.
    - ```Javascript
        getDatabase( initializeAppObject )
      ```
  - **ref()** to reference (connect to) a value inside the database. You have to pass the variable where you stored the getDatabase() result and the name of the reference.
    - ```Javascript
        ref( getDatabaseObject, "referenceName" )
      ```
  - **push()** to send a value to store in the database. You have to pass the variable where you stored the ref() result and the value.
    - ```Javascript
        push( refObject, value )
      ```
  - **onValue()** to listen to changes in the database, and call a function when the changes occur. You have to pass the variable where you stored the ref() result and the function, with a parameter, that will be called.
    - ```Javascript
        onValue( refObject, function( parameter ){ console.log( parameter ) }) 
      ```
  - **snapshot:** the parameter of the onValue() function, and the information that the database sends to us.
    - `snapshot.val():` the content of the reference, stored as an object. Here are stored the values and the IDs associated with them. 
    - `snapshot.exist():` to know if a reference exists (has values stored inside) or not
  - **ID:** a random string sequence associated with the values stored in the database
  - **remove()** to remove elements of the database. You have to pass the exact location of the element 
    - ```Javascript
        remove( ref( getDatabaseObject, "containerName/itemID") )
      ```
- **Object to array:** Object methods to transform objects to array format.
  - `Object.values()` `Object.keys()` `Object.entries()`
- **createElement()** method, to create HTML elements. You have to pass the HTML element you want to create in the argument
- **flex-wrap** CSS property, to let the items of the container wrap when they don't fit in it.
- **gap** CSS property, to create a gap between the flexbox items, like margin.
- **user-select** CSS property, to disable selection for elements in the document.
- **meta** HTML tag, in this case to **modify the viewport** for mobile-devices
- **favicons** to add an image in the website tab
- **Web Application Manifest** to make web apps look like native phone apps.
